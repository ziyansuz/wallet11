#### CreateWalletAccount

create wallet page in `createAccount.html`, the server function are `createAccountHtml`   and    `createAccountAction`

- `createAccountHtml` function is render the `createAccout.html` page.
- `createAccountAction` function is used to deal the password and use the web3 api to createAccount and return the account entity.

#### UnlockWalletAccount

UnlockWallet is a step before you send a transaction，if you don't the step，it will throw a error when you want to send a transaction from one address to another address.

You can unlock your wallet account according muliple ways，in this project, there are two ways archive this step：Keystore File and PriavateKey。

##### Keystore File：

The function `unlockAccountWithKeystore` support you upload a keystone file and password, the method use the web3 api `web3.eth.accounts.decrypt(JSON.parse(keystoreData), password)` to get the account object.

In this project, there is a page named `downloadkeystore.html`, you can download the keystore file to local disk.

##### PrivateKey：

The function `unlockAccountWithPrivateKey` support you post a privatekey data, the method use the web3 api `web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privatekey)` to get the account object.

#### SendTransaction

If you are already unlock wallet account ,now you can try to send some eth from one address to another address.

The method `sendTransaction` is used to archive the sendTransaction function. In this method, you should post a form data ,including : fromaddress, toaddress, value.

The sendTransaction function is in `transaction.html`

#### QueryTransaction

If you want to query one transaction,  you need to know the transactionHash first. So the method `queryTransaction` in transaction.js file is used to query the transaction detail info.
